	What is Colaboratory?
Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with

	- Zero configuration required
		-!pip install tensorflow
	- Free access to GPUs
	- Easy sharing
	- Compatible with other jupyter notebooks and alternatives

	- visualizations
	- images, HTML, LaTeX 
	- full power of popular Python libraries
	- shared like a google doc

	- seedbank project
		colab notebook community
		
	- "With Colab you can import an image dataset, train an image classifier on it, and evaluate the model, all in just a few lines of code. Colab notebooks execute code on Google's cloud servers, meaning you can leverage the power of Google hardware, including GPUs and TPUs, regardless of the power of your machine. All you need is a browser."
	- TensorFlow

	- Colaboratory is integrated with Google Drive. It allows you to share, comment, and collaborate on the same document with multiple people:

		- The SHARE button (top-right of the toolbar) allows you to share the notebook and control permissions set on it.

		- File->Make a Copy creates a copy of the notebook in Drive.

		- File->Save saves the File to Drive. File->Save and checkpoint pins the version so it doesn't get deleted from the revision history.

		- File->Revision history shows the notebook's revision history.		
		
		
# Differences

## Jupyter Notebook

- not cloud based
- various languages like R, Python, Scala, etc

## advantages

- momory dependant on your machine, as well as GPU
- 
- 

## Google Colab

- cloud based
- Python

### advantages
- sharing: can share Jupyter notebook with others without having to download, install, or run anything
- can reduce computational cost
- versioning: save to GitHub without git commands
- code snippets: Google Library, I'll demonstrate
- Forms for non-technical users
- performance using virtual machines, not own machine
- free version

### limitations
- no way of knowing which type of GPU you are connected to, can use GPU for 12 hours
- access to limited resources, $9,99/m pro version
- resources are prioritized, hardware availability and memory shortage

- "Created by Google Research, Matthew Turk (creator of the yt visualization package), and the IPython/Jupyter development team, coLaboratory merges successful open source products with Google technologies, enabling multiple people to collaborate directly through simultaneous access and analysis of data. This provides a big improvement over ad-hoc workflows involving emailing documents back and forth."

https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html

- "In 2014 we worked with the Jupyter development team to release an early version of the tool. Since then Colab has continued to evolve, guided by internal usage."

- Google made Colab free for public use since 2017.
